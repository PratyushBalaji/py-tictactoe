# Py-TicTacToe
This is my Python TicTacToe project! Have not used any video tutorials and am just going off of my Python knowledge. I did a bit of googling but thats pretty much it.

Currently, V2 is the best & most functional version created so far. Still have to build in some new features but no fundamental changes so it will continue as V2.XX

# I present to you : V1. 
Not very readable / understandable due to the large amount of if statements used (31 if statements in 100 lines of code). 
But still functional with a few missing features

# And here is V2 : 
This is a much better version. V2 features the use of 2d arrays, a concept I didn't know, but had known of. 
2 mins of googling later, I was able to use it very well (I hope) in 2 cases.
- Eliminating the use of the variables line1, line2 & line3,
- Allowing for the easy addition and deletion of custom win conditions with a simple 2d array of 6 numbers per array. 
Reduces if conditions heavily. Also allows me to check if the game is won with a single line instead of 8 lines (for 8 possible scenarios!)
Even with added functionality, the code only comes to 77 lines. 

Yes I know everything can be written in 1 line and lines shouldn't be how you measurecode, blah, blah, blah, but it is a useful metric in this case. 
Showing how effective and efficient V2 is compared to V1. And how much more readable!

Notes : 
Added basic comments in various areas for understandability. 
As well as a section at the bottom which acts as a to do list and stuff I learnt. 
Also, the winCondition[] array was inspired by the recipe json file in Minecraft where the pattern is shown in []. Instead of a pattern, I have given the coordinates.


So far, I'm pretty happy with the result. Will work on it soon but for now, install and enjoy!

Disclaimer : I call lists arrays as I started off programming with HTML, CSS, JS. I know they are lists and are technically different, but it means the same to me.
